## Some issues ##

For the Resort Types and Sign up button in the header, the text seems to be
invisible unless you hover over it. I believe it has something to do with the routing, however I am crunched on time to fix it.

Also, CSS was an issue that I had no time to deal with it. I wish I could make it more presentable!
